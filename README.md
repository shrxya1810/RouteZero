# RouteZero Backend (Walmart Sparkathon)

**RouteZero** is a modular, production-grade FastAPI backend for sustainable logistics, built for the Walmart Sparkathon. It provides advanced route optimization, emissions tracking, green carrier assignment, eco points, reverse logistics, and LLM-powered explanations for eco-friendly delivery.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

RouteZero powers eco-conscious delivery by:
- Optimizing delivery and return routes for minimal emissions
- Assigning the greenest feasible carrier (EV, hybrid, diesel) per route
- Calculating and rewarding eco points for sustainable choices
- Providing natural language explanations (via LLM) for every route
- Enabling reverse logistics (pairing returns with deliveries)
- Exposing a robust, CORS-enabled API for frontend and AI integration

---

## üåü Key Features

- **Route Optimization**: Multi-criteria, carbon-aware route selection using OpenRouteService
- **Emissions Calculation**: Per-route CO‚ÇÇ emissions for all vehicle types
- **Green Carrier Matching**: Assigns best vehicle (EV/hybrid/diesel) based on distance and feasibility
- **Eco Points System**: Gamified, tiered rewards for low-emission routes
- **LLM Integration**: Dynamic, user-friendly explanations for any route via `/generate-explanation`
- **Reverse Logistics**: Pairs returns with deliveries within 3km for circular logistics
- **CORS Support**: Ready for frontend and cross-origin requests
- **Robust Validation & Error Handling**: For all endpoints and payloads
