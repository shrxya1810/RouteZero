## Vision & Context

Every day, thousands of vehicles traverse millions of miles‚Äîmoving inventory across farms, fulfillment centers, and neighborhoods. Behind this scale lies a cost: billions lost to inefficient routing and rising fuel costs. By 2030, last-mile CO‚ÇÇ emissions are set to grow 30%, threatening both Walmart‚Äôs margins and its mission.

**Meet RouteZero ‚Äî Walmart‚Äôs intelligent logistics layer ‚Äî focused on reducing emissions and boosting profitability.**

- **Up to 40% reduction in fuel and logistics costs**
- **Gamified Eco Points to improve customer retention**
- **34% CO‚ÇÇ reduction across test corridors**

At the core are four powerful engines:
- **Carbon-Aware Routing**: Picks the greenest routes, not just the fastest, using elevation, traffic, load, and emissions data.
- **Smart Carrier Matching**: Dynamically assigns EVs, hybrids, or diesel for optimal sustainability and cost.
- **Pickup-Hub Optimization**: Leverages Walmart stores as micro-distribution hubs, clustering deliveries for fewer trips and less idle time.
- **LLM Explainability**: Every routing decision is transparent and AI-aligned, with plain-English explanations for managers and customers.

- **API Backend (FastAPI)**: Powers all logistics intelligence, emissions, and explainability.
- **Manager Dashboard (business_facing)**: B2B operational intelligence for Walmart managers, fleet operators, and associates.
- **Customer Integration (frontend-ui)**: B2C layer on Walmart.com, gamifying greener choices and loyalty.

## Features

### Walmart Manager Dashboard (B2B Internal Interface)
Empowers Walmart‚Äôs supply chain managers with real-time operational intelligence:

- **Carbon-Aware Routing Engine**: Optimizes for lowest carbon per mile, not just speed. Result: 34% CO‚ÇÇ reduction in test corridors.
- **Intelligent Fleet Matching**: Assigns EVs for city hops, hybrids for mid-range, and efficient diesel for long hauls‚Äîmirroring Walmart‚Äôs 4,900-EV expansion plan.
- **Hub-Store Pickup Consolidation**: Transforms 8,000+ stores into micro-distribution hubs, clustering deliveries for a 50% drop in delivery emissions.
- **Live Metrics & Analytics**: Executive overview, real-time CO‚ÇÇ footprint, fleet efficiency, active routes, and weekly savings.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Emissions hotspots, cost breakdowns, and fleet performance.
- **Fleet & Hub Management**: Monitor vehicle efficiency, manage hubs, schedule predictive maintenance, and coordinate teams.
- **Bulk Route Planning**: Plan, optimize, and manage thousands of deliveries at scale.
- **LLM Explainability**: Transparent, AI-aligned explanations for every routing decision.

### Customer-Facing Integration on Walmart.com (Gamification + Loyalty Layer)
Drives customer loyalty and sustainability through gamified experiences:

- **LLM Explainability (/explain-route)**: Every route, vehicle, and delivery time is explained in plain English, aligned with Walmart‚Äôs Responsible AI policy.
- **Eco Points & Smart Rescheduling**: Customers earn rewards for greener delivery windows (e.g., ‚ÄúSwitch to Friday, earn 30 Eco Points, cashback, or coupons‚Äù).
- **Carbon Receipt System**: Every delivery comes with a shareable receipt showing CO‚ÇÇ saved, packaging reused, and delivery tier.
- **Customer Loyalty Loop**: Top green customers earn extra coupons, next-day delivery credits, and sweepstakes entries‚Äîturning sustainability into stickiness and higher basket size.
- **Seamless Nudges**: 65% opt-in rate for greener delivery choices in pilot.
