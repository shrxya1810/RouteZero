## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### Route Optimization Engine
```python
# Advanced route calculation with emission consideration
def get_routes_safe(source: List[float], destination: List[float]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Carbon-aware route optimization with multiple criteria:
    - Distance optimization
    - Emission calculation
    - Traffic consideration
    - Vehicle type matching
    """
```

#### Emission Calculation System
```python
# Multi-vehicle emission modeling
def calculate_emissions(distance_km, vehicle_type="car"):
    """
    Calculates CO2 emissions with eco-friendly categorization:
    - Low emissions (‚â§50g): eco_friendly
    - Medium emissions (51-150g): mid
    - High emissions (>150g): non_eco
    """
```

#### Eco-Tagging and Sorting
```python
# Automatic route categorization and sorting
def get_eco_tag(emission_level: str) -> str:
    """
    Converts emission levels to user-friendly eco tags:
    - eco_friendly: Most sustainable options
    - mid: Balanced options
    - non_eco: Traditional routes
    """
```

### API Endpoints

#### Route Optimization
```http
POST /route-options
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "source": [77.6413, 12.9716],      // [longitude, latitude]
  "destination": [72.8777, 19.0760]   // [longitude, latitude]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
